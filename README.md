# BLINKIT-PROJECT
Analyzed BlinkIT grocery sales data using Excel. Cleaned data with Power Query and built an interactive dashboard using pivot tables, charts, and slicers to track KPIs like total sales, average sales, and category-wise performance for data-driven insights.


## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing BlinkIT grocery sales data to uncover key business insights related to sales performance, customer preferences, and product categories.
Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed raw transactional data and built an interactive dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard provides a consolidated view of total sales, average sales, item performance, outlet analysis, and customer behavior.
